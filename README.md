# BLP-Based-LSM-Access-Control
Topic:

    Research and Implementation of Linux File Access Control Mechanism Based on LSM

Research content:

   (1) BLP access control model
   (2) LSM security module implementation
   (3) Linux file access mechanism
   (4) LSM deployment mechanism

Purpose requirements:
  
   1. Use c or c++ to implement the access control process
   2. Master the principle of LSM configuration and installation
   3. By analyzing the implementation principle of LSM in Linux system, adopting BLP idea to implement a Linux file access control mechanism.

Expected target:
   Complete the LSM-based Linux file BLP access control mechanism.
